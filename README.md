In this project, we have built an app for JEE entrance exam aspirants that creates a medium of communication between IIT/NITians and upcoming JEE aspirants.
It contains a channel of guides who are studying in top institutes in the country- the IITs and NITs, who can solve their doubts and motivate them towards their final goal. The app allows the user to sign in as aspirants or guides which are then verified by the database we collect from all institutes. The aspirant can freely ask and post his questions and doubts in the app which can be answered by the guides and fellow aspirants. The guides will keep posting motivational videos and other attachments like study material, formula books, etc.

The app also facilitates one-to-one chatting between the guide and the aspirant where the guides can share their experiences and struggles. The aspirants will also be able to follow the mentor he or she likes. 
The main feature of the application is that you can upload your doubts directly on the feed screen or can discuss them with the guides(students from various IITs and NITs). You can also view the study material uploaded by these guides in a systematic manner. This facilitates the students to have easy access to material and guidance that everyone needs. 

The tech used by us is Flutter and Firebase. Flutter being a new and multiplatform language facilitates us to expand our application to both Android and IOS simultaneously. We’ve used Firebase as our used data repository being easy to implement and a really powerful tool.
Briefly, some of the features used are:
•	file_picker(in order to select file from your device)
•	firebase_auth(for the authorisation of user during login via email and password)
•	firebase_storage(in order to store the files in the firebase database)
•	image_picker(to select images from the device)
•	synfusion_flutter_pdfviewer(to view the study material uploaded by guides)
•	video_player(to play the motivational videos uploaded by guides)


The following are the Salient Features of this app:
•	It allows IIT/NIT students to upload study material on the application and allow aspirants to view the same.
•	The study material is being categorized systematically into different sections such as books, handbooks, and formula books.
•	It allows the authorized users to upload motivational or topic-specific videos and motivational quotes. Aspirants can also upload their questions on the home page where the comment section gives a platform to guides to answer the questions and aspirants to ask any questions regarding the material uploaded.
•	It allows aspirants to ask questions directly to IIT/NIT students using the chat feature.
•	The search feature helps aspirants to follow a guide and access their uploaded study material.
